# Battleship Game

This is a simplified implementation of the classic board game, Battleship.

## How it Works

The game is set up with two boards: one for the player and one for the computer. The boards are created with a Gameboard object, which is a 10x10 array where each cell can either contain a ship or not.
Ships are placed on the gameboard in random positions at the start of the game. Each player has a fleet of 10 ships of varying lengths.
Players take turns attacking cells on the opposing player's board. When all of the cells of a ship have been hit, the ship is considered sunk. The game continues until all of one player's ships have been sunk.
